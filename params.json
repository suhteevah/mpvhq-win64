Many changes have been made, a\r\nlarge part of which is incompatible or completely changes how the player\r\nbehaves. Although there are still many similarities to its ancestors, mpv\r\nshould generally be treated as a completely different program.\r\n\r\nmpv was forked because we wanted to modernize MPlayer. This includes\r\nremoving cruft (including features which stopped making sense 10 years ago),\r\nand of course adding modern features. Such huge and intrusive changes made it\r\ninfeasible to work directly with MPlayer, which is mostly focused on\r\npreservation, so a fork had to be made. (Actually, mpv is based on mplayer2,\r\nwhich already started this process of removing cruft.)\r\n\r\nIn general, mpv should be considered a completely new program, rather than a\r\nMPlayer drop-in replacement.\r\n\r\nmpvhq is based on mpv and focuses on videophile quality features and was\r\noriginally created because of disagreements with the mpv developers, but\r\ncurrently exists more as a testbed for my own personal improvements, that will\r\nhopefully all make their way back into mpv.\r\n\r\nIf you are wondering what's different from mplayer2 and MPlayer, an incomplete\r\nlist of changes is located on the mpv website.\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\n\r\nThanks to Haasn and everyone over at mpv\r\n\r\nHaasn:https://github.com/haasn\r\n\r\nmpvhq:https://github.com/haasn/mpvhq\r\n\r\nmpv:https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv\r\n\r\n## License \r\n\r\n\r\n[GPLv2](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/blob/master/LICENSE)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
