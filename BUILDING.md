# Before starting, make sure you install MXE prerequisites. MXE will download
# and build all target dependencies, but no host dependencies. For example,
# you need a working compiler, or MXE can't build the crosscompiler.
#
# Refer to
#
#    http://mxe.cc/#requirements
#
# Scroll down for disto/OS-specific instructions to install them.

# Download MXE. Note that compiling the required packages requires about 1.4 GB
# or more!

# Set build options.

# The JOBS environment variable controls threads to use when building. DO NOT
# use the regular `make -j4` option with MXE as it will slow down the build.
# Alternatively, you can set this in the make command by appending "JOBS=4"
# to the end of command:
echo "JOBS := 4" >> settings.mk

# The MXE_TARGET environment variable builds MinGW-w64 for 32 bit targets.
# Alternatively, you can specify this in the make command by appending

echo "MXE_TARGETS := x86_64-w64-mingw32.static" >> settings.mk

# Build required packages. The following provide a minimum required to build
# a reasonable mpv binary (though not an absolute minimum).

# build tools involved (e.g. it will use i686-w64-mingw32.static-gcc).
